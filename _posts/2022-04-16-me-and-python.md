# Hello again! Here are my remarks on the past two weeks learning Python.

**Q: What are the primary uses for Python?**

Answers:

**1.)** To be used as an educational tool for introducing students to the world of computer programming. This is why Python is widely used in both coding boot camps as well as Universities.

**2.)** Python is also widely regarded as a great Data Science programming language due to the many tools built into it. These tools are extremely useful for those who wish to use algorithms to search through massive amounts of data. An example of this would be a research paper looking into data trends of past NBA champions in order to predict the next one.

**Q: What are some positives to using Python?**

Answers: 

**1.)** A positive is that since the syntax is pretty straightforward students can focus more on the logical steps where as other "strong typed" languages have a lot more nuance or just straight up confusion.

2.) Another positive is that there is am immense amount of support for the language. Since it is so widely used there are few problems you will encounter that someone else has not.


**Q: What are some downsides to using Python?**

Answers:

**1.)** It has very little use in mobile devices since Android and iOS do not support a mobile version of Python.

**2.)** It uses a lot more RAM than your typical programming language. It has no multithreading capabilities which creates a bottleneck in memory allocation.
